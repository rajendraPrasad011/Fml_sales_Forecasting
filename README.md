The Sales Forecasting Project aims to revolutionize business planning by leveraging predictive
analytics on a five-year historical sales dataset. Employing a multifaceted approach, including Seasonal
Naive and Linear Regression models, the project evaluates and compares their performance
using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and MAPE. The linear regression model outperforms the seasonal
naive model, showcasing superior accuracy in forecasting future sales. This study not only contributes
insights into effective forecasting methodologies but also underscores the transformative
potential of data-driven decision-making in navigating dynamic market landscapes. The findings
affirm the projectâ€™s goal of enhancing operational efficiency and strategic planning for sustained
business growth.
