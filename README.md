Sales forecasting, drawing insights from historical sales data, serves multifaceted purposes, including
enhancing accuracy, optimizing resource allocation, aiding in budgeting and financial planning, and
refining inventory management.Here, we evaluated two models for forecasting sales: the seasonal
naive model and the machine learning-driven linear regression model.
In our analysis concludes that within choosen dataset, the linear regression model showcased superior
performance over the traditional seasonal naive model. Its lower error rate signifies enhanced predictive
capabilities, offering greater accuracy in anticipating future sales trends. Hence, the adoption of the
linear regression model stands as a more reliable and effective approach for sales forecasting compared
to the seasonal naive model.
